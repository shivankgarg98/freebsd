## **audit(4) support to NFS: idea and design document**



1. **Where should the audit hooks be added to  efficiently audit the NFS RPC from server?**

I chose to add `AUDIT_NFSRPC_ENTER` and `AUDIT_NFSRPC_EXIT` macros in `nfs_proc()` function defined in `sys/fs/nfsserver/nfs_nfsdkrpc.c` The reason being it call the the `nfsrvd_dorpc` whenever their is some request. These macros are useful to for event preselection(TBD) and allocating/committing the new record.

When the thread will be servicing the RPC, the desirable RPC arguments can audited using the AUDIT_ARG_* macros.

2. **What all information has to be audited and recorded in log files?**

- Each RPC has to be audited and various desired argument in it should be audited. 

- To clarify above point: The client(subject) information, the NFS RPC request made by it and files etc, it accessed or modified.

- This all information that would have appeared in client's audit record if it'd be audit(4) runs on client.

3. **How would the audit(4) would be interpret the NFS records and show it ?**

The `praudit`has to be modified accordingly to able to interpret the new addition and show the record to user for analysis. (and able to distinguish them as NFS remote event by client and are not generated by local user)

4. **Do we need to define new audit event type, audit token for this new support? or Use currently defined?**

We will need to create new AUE_ events for each NFS RPC, since there is no 1:1 relationship between syscalls and RPCs.

5. **How would the NFS audit record look like?**

a. HEADER_TOKEN - can we use **Expanded Header Token** here and the Machine Address field to store client info?? See `struct auditinfo_addr`
b. information of the subject: some token describing subect info. 
c. information of the object affected by event. (that is some token describing file)
c. event-specific information: some token depending on RPC. for instance, it can describing a file, some attr, or some text, or IP address etc. See bsm_token.c and audit.log(5) for all such possibilty.
d. return token

Can I add a new token(NFS RPC) for the associating the already defined events(AUE_OPEN, etc.) and this wil differentiate the NFS server audit records when a client access the NFS shared dir v/s when some user on server access the NFS shared dir

If not above solution, then Do I need the define new audit events that are associated with RPC calls(and not on sycalls)?

Is there some other way?

#### Doubts while deploying the above design-

1. The audit record info is maintained by the thread structure. The thread may already be maintaining the audit records from the syscalls. I doubt when using this from NFS, it may interfare with syscall audit and show unexpected behaviour. For instance, failing of `KASSERT(td->td_ar == NULL, ("audit_syscall_enter: td->td_ar != NULL"))` if it is called in the `audit_nfsrpc_enter`.

>>> "The NFS server runs almost entirely within the kernel, but there is still a process associated with it.  That process spends almost all of its time within nfssvc(2).  As you have probably discovered, it generates its own audit record for that syscall (AUE_NFS_SVC, I think).  Your RPC-based audit records must be separate; you can't use the td_ar field of struct thread.  You'll have to find someplace else to store the RPC's audit record, and call audit_commit yourself."
This also means, unfortunately, that you can't use the AUDIT_ARG_ macros, since those call curthread.  You'll either have to modify those macros, or create substitutes for them.
